A simple example of a Shiny app using the Iris dataset. Shows the structure of a Shiny app -- the ui and server functions -- in a basic manner with accompanying explanations in code. Mainly used for reference use of the basic Shiny structure.

An example of a Shiny app using ggiraph for interactivity, e.g. selections and tooltips. Displays a coreopleth map of Africa for the selected measurement and year (one of GDP per capita, population or life expectancy). Countries can further be selected on the map to have their measurement shown in a time series over all available years.
